Update 1 (March 30, 2021):
    - Seperated between regular and promise implementation
    - Improved coding structure
    - Pascal case support
        > WaitFor.childPromise() instead of WaitFor.ChildPromise()
    - In WaitFor.childrenPromise(), instead of rejecting,
        expect all of the required children has been not found
        it will warn the user that any child is not yet found.
    - WaitFor.ChildrenThenGet is now removed in favor of WaitFor.Children
    - New Functions:
        > WaitFor.Seconds     	- No promise implementation because of Promise.Delay
        > WaitFor.NextStep
        > WaitFor.Event
    - No promise version added

Update 2 (March 30 - April 4, 2021):
    - Luau strict method is added
    - Documentated to see how it works (kinda)
    - WaitFor.Event is now strict (replaced with WaitFor.EventSafe)
    - WaitFor.Child functions are now optimized!
    - Informative and presentable error messages
    - New Functions:
        > WaitFor.ChildSafe
        > WaitFor.ChildrenSafe
        > WaitFor.Path 			- Inspired by: ChipioIndustries from his own module 'WaitForPath'
        > WaitFor.PathSafe

Update 3 (April 4, 2021 - April 11, 2021):
    - WaitFor.Children is scanning children simultaneously
        - For example (assume children = { "Hello", "Love", "Goodbye" })
            for _, childName in pairs(children) do
                spawn(function()
                    WaitFor.Child(parent, childName)
                end)
            end
    - WaitFor functions have now optional timeouts
